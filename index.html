          <p>Hi, I'm Tague. I love to teach.</p>
          <p>
            With a knack for breaking down complex concepts into understandable
            pieces, I strive to guide students towards those 'aha' moments where
            everything clicks. I believe in not just teaching the material, but
            also in helping students develop effective study habits and life
            skills that will serve them well beyond their educational journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dedication to excellence is reflected in my MCAT score, which
            placed me in the 95th percentile. I look forward to helping your
            child reach their full potential!
          </p>
